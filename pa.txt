I am a highly motivated, results-oriented individual willing to go the extra mile to reach goals and learn along the way. For example  
my last job involved meeting specific targets on a daily basis which I managed and sometimes surpassed while gaining better and effective means of improving the achievement of those goals.

I'm confident that if given opportunity, I'll thrive and deliver quality work within stipulated deadlines.

I look forward to contributing my skills and experiences to your Organization if given the opportunity.
