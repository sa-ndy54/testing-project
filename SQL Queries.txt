########

DDL(Data Definition Language) : DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
Examples of DDL commands:

CREATE – is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure and triggers).
DROP – is used to delete objects from the database.
ALTER-is used to alter the structure of the database.
TRUNCATE–is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
COMMENT –is used to add comments to the data dictionary.
RENAME –is used to rename an object existing in the database.

#######

DML statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

Example of DQL:

SELECT – is used to retrieve data from the a database.
###########
select * from candice c1 right join scorpion s2 on c1.id=s2.StdID;
select * from candice c1 inner join scorpion s2 on c1.id=s2.StdID;[shows only common elements]

natural joins : show data that have all fields same totally.


virtual table:
crete view one as select id,name,salary from candice where id =140.
drop view one. [delete view one]


Name    Salary
Jim       6
Foo       5
Bar       5
Steve     4

SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees))

Result --> Bar 5, Foo 5
